# SportsRk - MatchSim

This is a project made with Godot/C# and receives matches from the main app, simulating them and sending back the results.

## Usage

It can be opened with Godot 4.2.2 directly, no installation process needed. Execute it with a --headless flag within the cmd so it doesn't render a window. In the project, there's also a debug scene for the match simulator:
